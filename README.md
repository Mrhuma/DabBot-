An improved version of the DabSquadBot. A JSON file is used to store the phrases that the bot is checking. Each object within this file has a regex and an array of links associated with that expression. When the expression is detected within a channel, a link associated with it is randomly posted to the channel. I can make changes to this JSON file during runtime and send a command to the bot that forces it to check the file for any changes. This means I can change the phrases the bot is checking for, and the link associated with each phrase during runtime and without any downtime of the bot itself. The first version of this bot would only work with png files, however this bot can work with any filetype/link.
